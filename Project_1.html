            <p class="content">Over the past 5 weeks I have been growing spinach in three different shaped containers whilst keeping the volume of soil the same. This is to determine whether this change in shape has an effect on the growth weight of the plant.</p>

            <p class="content">The purpose of me doing this experiment and the reason why this is interesting is because it could allow you to change the amount of soil needed for germination of seeds just by changing the shape of the pot. Also depending of the results a change in shape could allow for better use of space when germinating seeds in confined areas.</p>

            <h3 class="header">Execution of the study</h3>
            <p class="content">One part of the study’s methodology varied from the initial methodology in the proposal. This was the use of LEDs to grow the plants. Instead of LEDs the plants were grown with light from the sun. The reason for this was time and money. I did not plan enough time for the building of the growing environment including the time it takes for LEDs and a power supply to be delivered. Also the amount of materials I needed was out of budget. Although there are risks that come with growing outside I did my best to mitigate these risks and better control the variables that come with growing plants outside. I did this by building a small greenhouse that fully encapsulated my experiment. This allowed me to still control water that the plants received and also keep the plants at around the same temperate and humidity. </p>

            <p class="content">The plants were removed after five weeks. They were not as big as I had hoped (mainly due to the cold weather) but they are still big enough to be transplanted to the ground. Therefore they should be big enough for me to weigh. A problem I had was removing the soil from the roots. I had to soak them for a couple of hours to loosen all of the soil from the roots. After being dried for around 15 hours they were weighed and averaged. These are the results.</p>

            <h3 class="header">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="content">At first these results may seem like it would be best to plant in the tall and wide containers because they produced a larger weighing plant but an interesting observation is that the normal container plants had much smaller roots (as you can see in the picture).  After weighing just the greens of the plants (all weighed 90 or 100 milligrams) I came to the conclusion that it was the roots of the tall and wide container plants that made them heavier.  “Roots grow where the resources of life are available.” Perry, T.O. (1982).  Roots will not grow too deep if they have adequate water and nutrients.  Plants in the early phase of water depletion show an increased shoot to root ratio (Bogeat-Triboulot, 2007). (Poorter, 2012) claims that this growth response of shoot to root ratio is strongly influenced by the severity of stress the plants are undergoing (stress can affect growth, survival and crop yields) and that plants exposed to moderate water deficiency (and therefore a lower level of stress) “generally show little change in their growth pattern, with only a small increase in the root biomass relative to the total biomass”.  Therefore it would seem that the plants in the tall and wide containers were stressed and needed more water than the normal sized container plant and that is why they grew larger and longer roots. </p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="header">Reflection</h3>
            <p class="content">After conducting this research I have found that taller and wider containers can add more stress to the plant at a young age as they do not collected water as efficiently as the plants in the normal containers.  Although plants in wide or tall containers could save space it could damage the plants long term if they did not receive enough water therefore personally I will not be planting my future seedlings in these containers.  Although it would be interesting to complete this study again and prevent the tall and wide container plants from going under stress by giving them more water.  As this space saving technique could be a viable option for commercial growers that have an abundance of water and not a lot of space to germinate seedlings. </p>
