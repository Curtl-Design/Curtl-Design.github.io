            <p class="content">Over the past 5 weeks I have been growing spinach in three different shaped containers whilst keeping the volume of soil the same. This is to determine whether this change in shape has an effect on the growth weight of the plant.</p>

            <p class="content">The purpose of me doing this experiment and the reason why this is interesting is because it could allow you to change the amount of soil needed for germination of seeds just by changing the shape of the pot. Also depending of the results a change in shape could allow for better use of space when germinating seeds in confined areas.</p>

            <h3 class="header">Execution of the study</h3>
            <p class="content">One part of the studyâ€™s methodology varied from the initial methodology in the proposal.  This was the use of LEDs to grow the plants.  Instead of LEDs the plants were grown with light from the sun.  The reason for this was time and money.  I did not plan enough time for the building of the growing environment including the time it takes for LEDs and a power supply to be delivered.  Also the amount of materials I needed was out of budget.  Although there are risks that come with growing outside I did my best to mitigate these risks and better control the variables that come with growing plants outside.  I did this by building a small greenhouse that fully encapsulated my experiment.  This allowed me to still control water that the plants received and also keep the plants at around the same temperate and humidity.    </p>
